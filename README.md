# myTasks: A simple daily task manager.
by mrivasperez. live demo: <https://mrivasperez.github.io/myTasks/>

## Description
myTasks is a simple, easy to use, and dynamic "web application" that a user can utilize to keep track of their daily tasks. I developed myTasks using HTML, CSS, and jQuery 3.4.1 (compressed, production). I hope that the comments included in assets/js/todos.js will be helpful for others to learn jQuery and understand it's ease of use in creating similar web apps and services.

## Installation
This web app can be used using the live demo at <https://mrivasperez.github.io/myTasks/> or by downloading the repo as a zip file. To use the web app, create a new folder in your system then drag and drop the contents of the zip file to that folder. Double click "index.html" in the new folder to open and begin to use the web app.

## How to use

### The interface
When the user uses the web app, they are greeted with a gradient background and a floating box with with the header "DAILY TASKS", an input field box with placeholder text "Add New Task," and a button on the top right corner of the box that is an icon with a pencil in it. 

### Adding tasks
To add a new task, the user must select the input box, type the task they desire to add, and then press the enter button on their keyboard. This will create the list where the user can 

### Completing and/or removing tasks
To mark a task as completed, the user must touch or mouseover the item they wish to delete or mark as completed. On mouseover, the user must click on the item to mark it as completed. On touch, the user marks the item as completed by touching the item. To delete the item, the user must click or touch on the red "X" icon to the left of the task list.

### What does the edit button do?
The edit button hides the input field to maximize vertical space and improve the aesthetic of the list when the user no longer wishes to add new tasks.

## Credits
I used Font Awesome for icons, Google Fonts (B612) for fonts, and uiGgradients (Moon Purple) for the gradient background.
